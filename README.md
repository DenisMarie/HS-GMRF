This repository contains the R codes and the R scripts to simulate data and to implement the HS-GMRF model presented in the Annals of Applied Statistics paper "Graph-structured variable selection with Gaussian Markov random field horseshoe prior" by M. Denis and M.G. Tadesse (submitted).

`MainFunction.R` file contains the R codes for the HS-GMRF model.

`UtilFunctions.R` file contains the R codes for constructing the contrast and adjacency matrices and for computing the Matthews correlation coefficient and mean squared error.

`call.R` ffile is a R script to run HS-GMRF on dataset simulated as in the paper.
