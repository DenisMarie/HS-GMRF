This repository contains the source code and sample R scripts to simulate data and to implement the HS-GMRF model presented in the Annals of Applied Statistics paper "Graph-structured variable selection with Gaussian Markov random field horseshoe prior" by M. Denis and M.G. Tadesse.

R code:

    MainFunction.R -- main function for performing the HS-GMRF model
    UtilFunctions.R -- functions called in the sample script
    call.R -- sample script to run HS-GMRF on simulated datasets and to compare results with HS
